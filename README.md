# Business-Model-for-the-NYSE-Industries
Business model provides deep insights into the company. It helps businesses or stakeholders know their stands against their competitors and take a peek into the future. In this project, the business models for all industries under the [NYSE sector](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse) would be built and insights which would help the industries make better decisions in the future drawn out from them.
## Description: 
The dataset consists of 1781 rows, 11 columns including: Ticker symbol- Stock symbol, Years- Number of years for which data was provided, Total Revenue, etc.
The project is divided into three sections, categorized into analyses (a cogent question would be asked about the business and this would be answered using the dataset supported with visualzations), creating Profit and Loss Statement dashboard and lastly, creating a financial model that forecasts the business stand for two more years.
### Section 1:
Under this section, a business problem was thrown and solved using the dataset. The question revolved round the profitability of the industries under the financial sector using the gross margin guage.
Visualizations and quick insights were then used to solve the challenge and was then saved in the `Business Guage` file attached.
### Section 2:
Here, a dashboard for a Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement which calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit (EBIT) for all companies under the NYSE industries (each company to be selected from a drop-down list) was created. The drop-down list pulled in all the historical fundamentals data used to create the P&L Statement.
<p>A static view of the spreadsheet named `Profit and Loss Statement` was attached.</p>

### Section 3:
A financial model for the company with ticker symbol **KEY** was built. The model forecasted out the Gross Profit and the Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using the three cases scenarios (Strong case, Base case and Weak case) selected from a drop-down menu, while the assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin changed for each scenario selected.

A screenshot of the model `Business Forecast` was attached.

## Conclusion:
With the dashboard and model built, the companies now know their losses and gains, where more money was being spent and where more was being earned. These would help them become more aware in the industry as they now know what to expect in the future and, the more aware a business is, the more firmly it can stand.
